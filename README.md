Magician Mode hack for Soul Blazer on SNES

Work-In-Progress hack for Soul Blazer on SNES:

1. Swords no longer do damage or affect monsters
2. Spells can damage bosses (even Deathtoll at the moment)
3. Spells can damage monsters vulnerable to specific swords if those swords are equipped
4. Spells cost 0 gems

Currently working on:

1. Having bosses damaged based on Sword Damage routine instead of Magic damage (otherwise, they are WAY too easy)
2. Code cleanup
3. Updating conversation with Magician Soul to reflect gameplay changes
